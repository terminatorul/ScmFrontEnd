INTRODUCTION                                             *minscm-introduction*

MinSCM is a plugin to manage your repositories of various SCM system (VCS).
MinSCM provides an abstract interface, so you can manage repositories without
being aware of differences between SCM systems.

Features:
  - Mercurial support
  - Git support
  - Bazaar support
  - Abstract interface
  - Many commands
  - Revision/Branch completion
  - Repositories report on status line


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                             *minscm-installation*

Put all files into your runtime directory. If you have the zip file, extract
it to your runtime directory.

You should place the files as follows:
>
        <your runtime directory>/plugin/minscm.vim
        <your runtime directory>/autoload/minscm.vim
        <your runtime directory>/autoload/minscm/mercurial.vim
        ...
<
And then update your help tags files to enable MinSCM help. See

OPTIONS                                                       *minscm-options*

                                                   *g:minscm_availableScms*  >
        let g:minscm_availableScms = ['git', 'mercurial', 'bazaar']
<
                Names of SCM systems which you want to use.

                If repositories of more than one SCM systems are found, the
                repository of SCM system which appears before others in
                g:minscm_availableScms has a priority.

                                                       *g:minscm_mapLeader*  >
        let g:minscm_mapLeader = '\s'
<
                Key sequence which MinSCM key mappings begin with.

                                              *g:minscm_mapLeaderAlternate*  >
        let g:minscm_mapLeaderAlternate = '\S'
<
                Key sequence which MinSCM key mappings begin with.

                This executes same commands as |g:minscm_mapLeader| except
                that reverses the priority of SCM systems.

                                                     *g:minscm_hgLogOption*
                                                    *g:minscm_gitLogOption*
                                                    *g:minscm_bzrLogOption*  >
        let g:minscm_hgLogOption = '--style compact'
        let g:minscm_gitLogOption = '--all --graph --pretty=format:''%h (%ci) %s'''
        let g:minscm_bzrLogOption = '--line'
<
                Option for the log command of each SCM system.
